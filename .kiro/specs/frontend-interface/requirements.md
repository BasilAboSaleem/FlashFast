# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A web-based frontend interface for the FlashFast e-commerce flash sale system that provides a user-friendly way to interact with both v1 (synchronous HTTP) and v2 (asynchronous queue) backend implementations. The frontend will enable users to register, login, browse products, participate in flash sales, and view their orders through a responsive web interface.

## Glossary

- **FlashFast_System**: The complete e-commerce flash sale backend system with v1 and v2 implementations
- **Frontend_Interface**: The web-based user interface that communicates with the FlashFast backend APIs
- **Flash_Sale_Event**: A time-limited sale event where products are sold at discounted prices with limited inventory
- **User_Session**: An authenticated user state maintained through JWT tokens
- **Admin_User**: A user with administrative privileges who can create products and flash sale events
- **Customer_User**: A regular user who can browse products and make purchases during flash sales

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new customer, I want to register for an account and login, so that I can participate in flash sales and track my orders

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the registration page, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display a form with fields for username, email, password, and role selection
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL send a POST request to the backend authentication endpoint and display success confirmation
3. WHEN a user accesses the login page, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display a form with email and password fields
4. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL store the JWT token and redirect to the dashboard
5. IF authentication fails, THEN THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to browse available products and active flash sale events, so that I can see what items are available for purchase

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the products page, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL fetch and display all available products with their details
2. WHEN a user accesses the flash sales page, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL fetch and display all active flash sale events
3. WHILE browsing products, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL show product name, description, price, and available stock
4. WHILE viewing flash sale events, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display event details including start time, end time, product information, and sale price
5. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL update product availability in real-time during active flash sales

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to purchase products during flash sale events, so that I can buy items at discounted prices

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer clicks purchase on an active flash sale, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL send a purchase request to the backend
2. WHILE a purchase is processing, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display a loading indicator to prevent duplicate requests
3. WHEN a purchase is successful, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display confirmation and update the product stock display
4. IF a purchase fails due to insufficient stock, THEN THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL only allow purchases during active flash sale time windows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view my order history, so that I can track my purchases and their status

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated customer accesses the orders page, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL fetch and display their order history
2. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL show order details including product name, quantity, price, and purchase date
3. WHILE displaying orders, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL organize orders by most recent first
4. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL only show orders belonging to the authenticated user
5. IF no orders exist, THEN THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create and manage products and flash sale events, so that I can set up sales for customers

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses the admin panel, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL display product and event management options
2. WHEN an admin creates a new product, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL send product data to the backend and display confirmation
3. WHEN an admin creates a flash sale event, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL validate event timing and send data to the backend
4. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL only display admin functionality to users with admin role
5. WHERE admin functionality is accessed, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL require proper authentication and authorization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to work with both v1 and v2 backend implementations, so that I can test and compare different backend approaches

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL use configurable API endpoints to connect to different backend versions
2. WHEN switching between backend versions, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL maintain the same user experience and functionality
3. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL handle API responses consistently regardless of backend implementation
4. WHERE backend version configuration is needed, THE Frontend_Interface SHALL use environment variables or configuration files
5. THE Frontend_Interface SHALL gracefully handle different response times between synchronous and asynchronous implementations
